[] make it 2-player
    [] make the game hold multiple snakes (but only set one)
        instead of snake.mv(game, point) it should be game.mv(snake, point)
        OR snake.mv(self, game, point)
            THIS ONE
        [done] OR mv(game, point)
        [done] try game.mv(snake, point) or game.mv(point)
        THEN change snake.update to use self instead of game
