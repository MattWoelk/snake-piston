[] make it 2-player
    [] make the game hold multiple snakes (but only set one)
        instead of snake.mv(game, point) it should be game.mv(snake, point)
        OR snake.mv(self, game, point)
            THIS ONE
        [done] OR mv(game, point)
        [done] try game.mv(snake, point) or game.mv(point)
        [] have two snakes that are both controlled by the same person.
            [] generate them in 2 random spots.
            [] make the game end when both die.
        [] make mv have everything passed in individually?
            This way we could run it for each snake?
            and keep the controls separate? (main issue)
        [] THEN change snake.update to use self instead of game
    [] allow the player to hit '2' to add a second snake
